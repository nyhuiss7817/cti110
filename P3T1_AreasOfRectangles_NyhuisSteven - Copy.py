'''
Write a program that asks for the length and width of two rectangles.
The program should tell the user which rectangle has the greater area,
or if the two rectangles have equal area.

This programâ€™s logic should have three branches:
1.	The first rectangle has the larger area
2.	The second rectangle has the larger area
3.	Both rectangles have equal area
