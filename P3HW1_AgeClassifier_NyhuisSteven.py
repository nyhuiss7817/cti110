'''
Write a program that asks the user to enter a personâ€™s age. The person should display a
message indicating whether the person is an infant, a child, a teenager, or an adult.
Follow these guidelines:
If the person is 1 year old or less, he or she is an infant.
If the person is older than one year, but younger than 13 years, he or she is a child.
If the person is at least 13 years old, but less than 20 years old, he or she is a teenager.
If the person is at least 20 years old, he or she is an adult.
